Step 1: Business Understanding
The primary goal is to understand the factors that influence the price of used cars. The insights gained will help the dealership optimize their inventory based on consumer preferences, potentially leading to better pricing strategies and increased sales.

Step 2: Data Understanding
We'll start by exploring the provided dataset to understand its structure and the types of data it contains.

Step 3: Data Preparation
We'll clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for analysis. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Step 4: Modeling
We'll use statistical models and machine learning algorithms to identify the factors that significantly affect car prices.

Step 5: Evaluation
We'll evaluate the models to ensure they accurately predict car prices and identify the most important features.

Step 6: Deployment
We'll summarize our findings and provide clear recommendations for the used car dealership.
